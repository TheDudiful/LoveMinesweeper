# LuaSweeper

This is Minesweeper, made for a University assignment.
It is made using Lua and the LÃ–VE2D framework.
All code, artwork and sound effects are made by me, Rosco Kalis.

This Repository tracks the process of refactoring the spaghetti code that I wrote in a week to something more readable and maintainable.
